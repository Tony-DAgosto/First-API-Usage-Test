The paper discusses the development of ShareStats, an open statistics item bank designed by university instructors in the Netherlands. It aims to support students' repeated study of statistics, crucial for social and behavioral sciences curricula. The item bank contains over 5000 quality-checked exercises, available in Dutch or English and shared under a Creative Commons License. This facilitates easy integration into online learning systems. A community of statistics instructors contributed to creating the bank, and the project encourages further contributions to open educational resources. The project is funded by the Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture and Science.
